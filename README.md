# Colonscopy-Video-Content-Analysis
Recently Video analysis and getting knowledge from videos has been use full technique in today's health care technology.Endoscope is one of today's technology that has get a grate attention in medical world.Many open surgical procedures now are being converted to endoscopic procedures including resection of gallbladders, retrieval of donor kidneys, resection of tumors of colon and pancreas, correction of hiatal hernias, coronary artery bypass grafting and minimal invasive neurosurgery's (i.e., video endoscopic neurosurgery).Endoscopic procedure is performed by endoscope with a tiny video camera at the tip of the endoscope,which generates a video signal of the interior of the human body.Despite a grate medical knowledge in colonscopy a little work has been so far done on developing a system that analysis the content of the video and provide user-friendly and efficient access to the medical, scientific, or educational content on such videos.

In this thesis we focus on analyzing of the content of a colonscopy video mainly focusing on stool and colon distention.There are other information's that could be extracted from colonscopy video that happen during colonscopy procedure including uninformative frame detection,surface area evaluation,biopsy,tissue specimen detection,polyp detection,clarity,audio,bleeding detection.As for thesis we have limited time we focus on stool detection and classification,colon distention and classification.
Color based object recognition has shown a significant role in the field of medical imaging technology.In our study made on the previous algorithm implemented using color feature has also shown a significant accuracy in stool detection from a colonscopy video.We continue to work over this feature to learn over standard bowel preparation methods like Boston bowel preparation and we used SVM classifier to learn over the selected color features.

As recently deep learning have shown a significant role on learning a good representative features in images classification especially through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), In this thesis we explore small deep leaning networks for colon distention classification.However CNN training for automated colon distention classification  still provides a challenge due to the lack of large and publicly available annotated databases.we compared our results with previously implemented based on classical shape feature ,further more we explored transfer learning mainly off-the-shelf training and compared the results with CNNs trained from scratch and using classical features.
